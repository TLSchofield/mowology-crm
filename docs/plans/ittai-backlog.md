# Ittai backlog — features to carry from Mowology to every tenant

The running list of what Ittai tenants need. Add to it as Mowology proves things. Each item names
what is **shared** across all tenants (knowledge, formats, rules about the world) and what stays
**private** to a tenant (their people, prices, accounts and decisions). That split is the standing
rule.

Direction (council, 2026-10-12): keep the data discipline-neutral, and build and sell to field-service
trades first. The AI back office is the edge.

## Inbox tidy for every tenant (Yui) — added 2026-10-13
- **Mowology today:** Yui sorts the iCloud inbox into folders using the CRM's own clients, suppliers
  and payment senders. It is preview-first, moves only, never deletes, and every batch can be undone.
  "Keep it tidy" files new mail automatically once switched on.
- **Tenant model (Tim, 2026-10-13): the tenant teaches, Yui applies.**
  - Each message or sender gets simple buttons: **"Is work"**, **"Not work"** and "Always put in…".
    A click creates a rule for that tenant only, and Yui applies it from then on.
  - Yui may *suggest* a folder, but she only moves on rules the tenant confirmed (plus the
    tenant's CRM contacts).
  - Safer than guessing: nothing moves on a hunch, and every rule traces back to a click.
- **Shared:** sender rules for well-known services (Amazon/Home Depot → receipts, Interac → money,
  Twitter/X → promos, etc.). Fixes found by any tenant go into the shared list, e.g. the Twitter/"Bill"
  misfile on 2026-10-13.
- **Private:**
  - "Is work" rules, contacts and suppliers;
  - the folder plan, fitted to the trade;
  - mailbox credentials, encrypted per tenant.
- **Needs:**
  - per-tenant mailbox connection, with iCloud/IMAP app passwords plus Google and Microsoft OAuth;
  - site_id on the mail_tidy tables;
  - a settings page with the "Is work" buttons on Yui's inbox card and in the tidy preview.

## Receipts as the way in (Penny) — council 2026-10-12
- A free or cheap receipts-only entry tier *inside* Ittai, not a separate app. The upgrade moment is
  "put this receipt on a job" or "bill this cost".
- Penny's edge: knows the jobs, the province's taxes and the trade's rules; checks against supplier
  price lists.
- Canada first: Jobber's bookkeeping is US-only.
- Shared: receipt layouts, vendor names, bank-wording patterns. Private: amounts, payers, rules.

## Penny proves her own books + head learning (all heads) — plan 2026-10-13
- `docs/plans/2026-10-13-penny-upgrade-and-head-learning.md`: lessons record, rules in shadow mode,
  mistakes as tests, scorecards, and Charlie's weekly report card on every head.
- Shared: the learning machinery and scorecard format. Private: each tenant's lessons and rules.

## Supplier price lists and the shared catalogue (Otto/Penny) — built 2026-10-12
- Import formats are data (Inline Nurseries first).
- A shared category tree for every trade family (plants, plumbing, electrical, salon supplies…).
- Botanical and part-number matching; a review queue for fuzzy matches.
- Shared: formats, catalogue, aliases, size equivalents. Private: price lists, prices, which suppliers
  a tenant uses.
- Later: an anonymised materials price index, once there are enough tenants and with consent.

## Staff permissions page — Tim 2026-10-12
- A role × permission tick grid, per tenant. Admins and managers edit; only anything touching an
  admin needs users.manage.

## Switch from Jobber tool — `docs/plans/2026-10-12-ittai-switch-from-jobber.md`
- Lessons from Mowology's own migration: accountant's year-end first, bank first, payer interview,
  remittance reading, and Jobber's late "marked paid" dates.

## Security and health watch (Ada) — built 2026-10-13
- Nightly security-posture checks: blocked paths, stray data files, DB privileges, Stripe webhook
  events, payment-mail signatures, backups heartbeat, audit export, certificates, dependencies, drift,
  page render health, migrations, error spikes, mail DNS.
- Each tenant site gets the same checks.
- Before any outside tenant: real tenant isolation, a data-only DB user, tested backups, nonce CSP,
  and an independent penetration test (audit report 2026-10-12).

## "Personal" on receipts and bank lines (Penny) — plan 2026-10-13
- `docs/plans/2026-10-13-move-to-personal.md`: one button covers three cases (personal on own card →
  out of the books; business on own card → owed to the owner; personal on the business card →
  shareholder account). A personal list with T1 tags exports for the accountant. Not a second ledger.
- Shared: the seed list of usually-personal vendor types. Private: each owner's own personal vendors.

## Receipt catch-up, vendor by vendor, teaching Penny as you go (STANDARD) — built 2026-10-14
- Tim: "This should be a standard. Other tenants may join with 100's of receipts." Every tenant's
  receipt review works this way, including the onboarding backlog.
- Penny's card groups waiting receipts by vendor, biggest group first. Approving unchanged counts toward
  her track record. A fix is a lesson; a reject keeps its reason.
- When the owner corrects a vendor the same way twice, she redoes that vendor's other waiting reads
  with the lesson: 10 at once, the rest by the background preparer first in line, within the daily cap.
- Private per tenant: the lessons (head_lessons.site_id) and track record. Shared: nothing yet.
  Candidate for the shared layer: vendor category/tax hints once 2+ tenants agree (the vendor
  knowledge commons already does this for confirmed receipts).
- Before 100s-of-receipts tenants: the daily cap (bookkeeper_daily_cap, default 40) needs an
  onboarding allowance, and the cost per receipt should be shown up front.
- BLOCKER before a second tenant: there is no "current tenant" lookup yet. Lessons are written and
  read as site_id 1 (HeadLessons default; PennyLessons::forVendor's $siteId). Once tenancy exists,
  every caller passes the tenant's site_id (Codex review 2026-10-14).

## Android crew app as a founding business sees it — first local run 2026-10-26
Seen on the emulator against `claudia.ittai.ca` on the local test site (`scripts/local-android.sh up`;
docs/LOCAL_SITE.md "Android emulator"). The server side is right: Host → tenant database, Ittai sign-in page,
native sign-in, the tenant's own schedule. The APP still says Mowology. In the order Tim called them:
1. **Splash shows the Mowology logo** (launcher icon + splash in `android/app/src/main/res`, shared by both
   flavors). A founding business must never see it.
2. **Sign-in screen reads "Mowology / Field Manager" and "Access is restricted to Mowology staff."** — hardcoded
   in the app, not from the server (the server's own sign-in page already says the business's name).
3. **Sign-in (and every native screen) uses Mowology green** (button, "Show", tabs, pills). Tim: "the sign in
   page should only be ittai design brand colors" — Ittai Design System v1.2 tokens, nothing of Mowology's.
4. **Initiation should start from a sign-up screen** (Tim). Today the app only signs in to a business someone
   already provisioned (TenantProvisioner, owner-run). The first screen for a new business must be sign-up:
   create the business, then the owner's login — i.e. self-serve provisioning from the phone.
5. Bottom tab bar on the day screen has 8 tabs with labels wrapped letter by letter ("To da y", "Se arc h") —
   unreadable on a Pixel-6-width screen.
6. Crew gets 403 on `team-mobile?mode=brief/brains` at every open (expected for crew, but the app asks anyway).
7. **Android day screen must match the iOS Schedule screen** (Tim, with the iPhone screenshot 2026-10-26: "they are
   meant to be similar/same"). iOS: five icon tabs — Schedule · Time Clock · Search · Receipts · AI Office; week
   strip with MON/TUE day names; each job card shows est. arrival time + distance, the service tag pill, "First
   visit" / "Last done N days ago", the client and the crew names, "n visit(s)", a ··· menu. Android today: eight
   text tabs, no arrival estimate, plainer cards, a "Display" link and a "Web app" button in the header.
   Map mode too (iOS screenshot 2026-10-26): the list/map toggle in the header, numbered pins with the address
   label, the current-position dot, a collapsible stop card (time, distance, "1/3", name, address, last-visit
   line) with **Directions** (filled) and **Move** (tonal) buttons, locate-me button — Android's map icon must
   open the same thing.
